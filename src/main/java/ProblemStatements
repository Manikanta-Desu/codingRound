HoteLBookingtest  :

	1.In PageFactory classes we  have to locate the elements in one class and corresponding testcases should be write in another class
		
		Ex : HotelBoolingPage & HoteBookingTest 
	
	2.when we use pagefactory concepts we must use the constructor for page classes we and return the pagefactory object elements
	3. Locating the page factory elements and creating driver instance in the same page, this will not help us to launch the browser
	4. Locate the elements for  the corresponding pages should have separate pages , here we locating all the elements in once class
	5. when you click the hotelLink button it will return HotelBooking page , here we are not returning or assigning anything for hotelLink.click() method
